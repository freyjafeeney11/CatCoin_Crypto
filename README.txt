Project description: 

Wallet.py displays a menu where you can choose to check wallet balances, transfer catcoins, or quit. 
The wallet balances are stored in three text files, wallet_1_balance.txt, wallet_2_balance.txt, 
and wallet_3_balance.txt. These files are updated and modified with each transaction, reflective the wallet's
current balance. In order to reset the balances in the beginning, you can go in an overwrite the balance to be 100 again. 
The user is able to transfer coins from one wallet file to another in the second menu option, Transfer CatCoins. 
blocks.txt stores the blocks, with each block having a block id, hash of the previous blocks header, timestamp and nonce, and previous_block_hash
of the current blocks data, then the "block_data" lists the source and destination wallet and the amount.
The hash is SHA256. miner_wallet.csv is updated with 10 catcoins for each transaction. 

Testing instructions:

- download miner.py, wallet.py, the three wallet files: wallet_1_balance.txt, wallet_2_balance.txt, wallet_3_balance.txt,
blocks.txt, miner_wallet.csv
- place all of the files in the same folder/directory
- run wallet.py and enter your choices/make transactions!
